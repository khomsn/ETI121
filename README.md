=====

The project explores and implements a signal processing algorithm, Normalised Least Mean Square, for acoustic echo cancellation. The algorithm was first prototyped in Matlab and then implemented in C using Code Composer Studio IDE on Texas Instruments DSK6713 DSP board. The project aims to cancel acoustic echo created by a system involving a near-end speaker and a loudspeaker delivering far-end signal. The results show that the NLMS algorithm can reduce the echo.
